Explaination:

I wanted to implement flex and grid so I thought to have a grid main page with a title section and 
info underneath. I also wanted to make it look most like a website so I put a navbar and a footer. 
Grid layout was used to the most effect in the main section where I used a grid to organize the paragraphs
and the titles. Flexbox was used the most to align my items in the center of the main page and it was
also used in the navbar and the footer to align and center items. Additionally, it was used to make a 
column in the navbar when the page got to a certain width. Chat GPT helped me solve different problems
with my website like spacing issues and grid problems. it also helped me better understand how grid
layouts work.
