Flex and Gridbox can be beneficial when creating responsive designs because they are easy to use
and make layouts for your website easy to understand and modify. Using Flexbox you can align your items 
and create responsive designs while using Grid can help you better layout where you want your
content to be located. when working together, they can be used together to create good-looking
and responsive designs. an example is having to display flex in the main section of your website
to align your grid content which is inside the main. this helps align your grid to the center while also keeping
your contents in the grid format. A visual example is my visual webpage with the "here is what you
need to know" section. the main part used flex to align the grid in the center.
