Grid-template-columns:
Defines the size and number of columns in the grid. 
You can specify using fixed values, percentages, or fr for fraction of available space.
Grid-template-rows:
Same as above except for the rows of your grid
Grid-gap:
The space between the grid items in both the rows and columns, 
can use two difference values to specify rows and columns
Grid template areas:
This property allows you to define named grid areas 
that you can later assign to specific grid items using the grid-area property. 
It provides a way to create complex grid layouts with clear visual structure.
Grid-auto-rows and columns:
These properties specify the size of rows and columns that are created 
implicitly when grid items are placed in the grid. 
This is useful when you have variable content and want to ensure 
a minimum size for automatically generated rows or columns
